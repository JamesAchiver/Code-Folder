This File Shows the Pesudo-code For the Calculator Development !

Pesudo-code for newCalc.js file ;

Create class names Calculator and inside it create a constructor function();
The constructor will contain two parameters ,the constructor takes previous & current operand + as well as Clear() ;
Inside class there are 7 function that define the working of Calculator :
    -- Clear()
    -- delete()
    -- chooseOperation()
    -- compute()
    -- appendNumber()
    -- getDisplayNumber()
    -- updateDisplay()

After class HTML Element arelinked with querySelectorALl(), querySelector()
Creatinhg variable type object named Calculator and will have two parameters .
So, there will be two types of selection multiple and single , multiple are linked by querySelectorAll() and single by querySelector().
//--> numberButtons and operationButton are called by "Multiple Selector" and other -- 
    -- equal
    -- allClear 
    -- delete 
    -- button
are called by single selector .

Defining "on-click" Working of Buttons   

--> On Defining numberButtons
    the variable numberButton "notated" with forEach function containing argument "Button"
    that is also "notated" with Arrow function for Defining Working of Button.
    --- inside Arrow Function the Event Listener is added with the button only when "Click",
        the performance of Event listener isto run appendNumber function And updateDisplay function .

--> On Defining operationButtons
    the variable operationButtons "notated" with forEach function containing argument "Button"
    that is also "notated" with Arrow function for Defining Working of Button.
    --- inside Arrow Function the Event Listener is added with the button only when "Click",
        the performance of Event listener isto run chooseOperation function And updateDisplay function .

//--> defining of working Single Selector

--> equalButton are notated with Event Listener with the "on-click" property and the performance is to run compute function and updateDisplay function .
--> allClearButton are notated with Event Listener with the "on-click" property and the performance is to run clear function and updateDisplay function .
--> deleteButton are notated with Event Listener with the "on-click" property and the performance is to run delete function and updateDisplay function .
